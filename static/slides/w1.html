# A few class policies

--
* Be kind


--
* Be understanding and have patience, with others **and yourself**


--
* Help others whenever possible


--
Truly the most important part of this class. Important not just in terms of decency, but also in your learning, and most importantly, for equity. 

---
# A more specific policy
### Kiddos in class

--

* All breastfeeding babies are welcome in class as often as necessary.

--

* Non-nursing babies and older children are welcome whenever alternate arrangements cannot be made. As a parent of two young children, I understand that babysitters fall through, partners have conflicting schedules, children get sick, and other issues arise that leave parents with few other options.

---

* In cases where children come to class, I invite parents/caregivers to sit close to the door so as to more easily excuse yourself to attend to your child's needs. Non-parents in the class: please reserve seats near the door for your parenting classmates.

--

* All students are expected to join with me in creating a welcoming environment that is respectful of your classmates who bring children to class.

# In-person class

---
# In-person class
* This class is in-person

* Your class participation grade comes exclusively from your active participation in the class through discussions and hands-on lab sessions

* If you are not feeling well, please do not attend in person

* See syllabus for attendance policy

---
# Last intro thing

* I'm here for you

* We won't have specific office hours, but know I'm always willing to meet

* This course, like all in the sequence, can be difficult. Don't suffer in silence. Don't do this alone.

# Materials
* Nearly everything will be distributed through the repo and through the website.

* Please clone the repo now, if you haven't already. 

* Pull each week for the most recent changes.

* We'll use Canvas for grading, and that is essentially it.

---
# R Markdown notes
* These slides were produced with [**{xaringan}**](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan), an R Markdown variant. I encourage you to try it out and use it for your final project presentation.

* The website was also produced with R Markdown (sort of)
  + It's a [**{blogdown}**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) website with some custom CSS and Hugo shortcodes
  
* This course is not just about data viz, but also mediums for communication. This includes websites and [data dashboards](https://jenthompson.me/examples/insight_progress.html) among other possibilities.

# My assumptions about you

---
# I assume you

* Understand the R package ecosystem (how to find, install, load, and learn about them)


--
* Can read "flat" (i.e., rectangular) datasets into R 

  + I don't care what you use, but you should be using RStudio Projects &amp; the [{here}](https://github.com/r-lib/here) package

    - See [Jenny Bryan's blog post](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/) for why.

---
* Can perform basic data wrangling and transformations in R, using the
tidyverse  

  + Leverage appropriate functions for introductory data science tasks (pipeline)
  + "clean up" the dataset using scripts and reproducible workflows

--

* Use version control with R via git and GitHub  


--
* Use R Markdown to create reproducible dynamic reports

--
* Indeed, all of today's lab is going to be about git and next week will be refresher on R Markdowns! 


---
# Learning objectives

* Transform data in a variety of ways to create effective data visualizations


--
* Understand best practices in data visualization


--

* Create and customize graphics in a variety of ways using best practices (e.g., visual perception, color choices, text annotations, categorical axis ordering, uncertainty)


--

* Build web-based platforms for sharing data visualizations

# Data viz "in the wild" presentations
Everyone will be randomly assigned a date to share two data visualizations you have found in publications, websites, or anywhere else IRL.

* Not a formal presentation

* Share the links with me before class - we'll look at it as a group and discuss

* You note where you found it and what you like/dislike about it

# Proposal

### Three components:

* Show me some evidence that you've at least played around with the course data and that you have some ideas of what you want to do

* *Very* preliminary visualizations, and/or hand-sketches of visuals you'd like to make, noting the data sources/columns to be used

* Identification of the intended audience for each viz 

* The intended message to be communicated for each viz 


--
## Main point - feedback!

---

# Peer Review (as part of Lab 8)
* We are all professionals here. It is imperative we act like it. 

* Understand the purpose of the exercise.  

* Zero tolerance policy for inappropriate comments

* Should be vigorously encouraging 

--

### Utilizing GitHub
You'll be assigned three proposals to review (3 points each, plus one bonus point for free)

* Fork their repo, embed comments &amp; suggest changes to their code, submit a PR

---
# Presentation 
Order randomly assigned. Basically a chance to share what you created!

* Presentation length will be determined later, but likely to be in the 10-15 minute range (note - you will present as a group)

* Share the final products

* Share the prior iterations

* Discuss the progression along the way and why specific changes were made

* What challenges did you face along the way? What victories did you have that you are particularly proud of?

# Intro to textual data

---
# Structured vs unstructured

* Most every dataset you've ever worked with is what is referred to as a **structured** dataset - it has rows and columns.

* But there is an incredible amount of data out there that is **unstructured** - it just sort of exists


--
* Most text data is unstructured. How would you analyze the contents of a book? No rows or columns there

---
# Getting text data

There are **many** ways to get text data. Any digital text could potentially be used as textual data.


--
How about Wikipedia?


--
Anything that lives on the web is a common use case. Social media data being perhaps primary among them.

---
# "Screen" scraping
Short foray into web scraping. It's not expected you fully follow this. More about "exposure" and less about building competencies.

--

Use the [rvest](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/) package to scrape the data you see "on the screen".


--

Let's read in the Wikipedia page on Eugene


``` r
library(rvest)
eugene &lt;- read_html("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene%2C_Oregon")
```


---
# Grab paragraphs
The `"#mw-content-text &gt; div.mw-parser-output &gt; p"` is the CSS selector that I pulled from the website

``` r
paragraphs &lt;- eugene %&gt;% 
  html_elements("#mw-content-text &gt; div.mw-parser-output &gt; p") %&gt;%
  html_text2()
```

The first paragraph is just an empty line, so they are numbered p + 1

Print the first paragraph


``` r
cat(stringr::str_wrap(paragraphs[2], 50))
```

```
## Eugene (/juːˈdʒiːn/ yoo-JEEN) is a city in and
## the county seat of Lane County, Oregon, United
## States. It is located at the southern end of the
## Willamette Valley, near the confluence of the
## McKenzie and Willamette rivers, about 50 miles (80
## km) east of the Oregon Coast.[10]
```

---
# Print the fourth paragraph


``` r
cat(stringr::str_wrap(paragraphs[5], 50))
```

```
## The first people to settle in the Eugene area
## were the Kalapuyans, also written Calapooia or
## Calapooya. They made "seasonal rounds," moving
## around the countryside to collect and preserve
## local foods, including acorns, the bulbs of the
## wapato and camas plants, and berries. They stored
## these foods in their permanent winter village.
## When crop activities waned, they returned to their
## winter villages and took up hunting, fishing, and
## trading.[20][21] They were known as the Chifin
## Kalapuyans and called the Eugene area where they
## lived "Chifin", sometimes recorded as "Chafin" or
## "Chiffin".[22][23]
```

---
# Analysis
How do we analyze the text? What we we even analyze?


--
First, let's structure it! Turn the text into a simple data frame.

--

``` r
library(tidyverse)
eugene_df &lt;- tibble(
  paragraph = seq_along(paragraphs),
  description = paragraphs
)
eugene_df
```

```
## # A tibble: 133 × 2
##    paragraph description                                                                                                                                           
##        &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                                                                                                                                                 
##  1         1 ""

# Can we analyze it now?

Not really... what would we analyze?


--
Words!

Let's break it into words. This is where the [tidytext](https://juliasilge.github.io/tidytext/) package comes into play.

---
# The `unnest_tokens()` function

Just like most functions in the tidyverse, we pipe our data to `unnest_tokens()`

* First argument is the name of the new column we want in our data

* Second argument is the text data to process

* Third argument is how the text should processed. The default is `"words"`, meaning the text will be broken into words.

---
# Example


``` r
library(tidytext)
eugene_tidy_words &lt;- eugene_df %&gt;% 
  unnest_tokens(word, description)
eugene_tidy_words
```

```
## # A tibble: 8,242 × 2
##    paragraph word     
##        &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    
##  1         2 eugene   
##  2         2 juːˈdʒiːn
##  3         2 yoo      
##  4         2 jeen     
##  5         2 is       
##  6         2 a        
##  7         2 city     
##  8         2 in       
##  9         2 and      
## 10         2 the      
## # ℹ 8,232 more rows
```

Not perfect, but pretty good

---
# What to do now?
Let's count some words!


``` r
eugene_tidy_words %&gt;% 
  count(word, sort = TRUE)
```

```
## # A tibble: 2,584 × 2
##    word       n
##    &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;int&gt;
##  1 the      626
##  2 and      266
##  3 of       256

##  5 eugene   184
##  6 a        138
##  7 to       121
##  8 is        94
##  9 for       78
## 10 was       76
## # ℹ 2,574 more rows
```

---
# Plot the top 15 words


``` r
eugene_tidy_words %&gt;% 
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %&gt;% 
  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %&gt;% # make y-axis ordered by n
  slice(1:15) %&gt;% # select only the first 15 rows
  ggplot(aes(n, word)) +
    geom_col(fill = "cornflowerblue")
```

![](w1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---
# Not very informative

## Why?

--
Most of the words are common words like "the", "and", "of" (top three words)


--
These are referred to as "stop words".


--
Luckily, **tidytext** provides us with a dictionary of stop words. We can use an `anti_join()` with this dictionary to remove these words.

---
# Quick refresher

A `semi_join()` works just like an `inner_join()`, but without adding any columns. A `semi_join()` works by **keeping** only rows that are in common with the two datasets.


--
An `anti_join()` does basically the opposite, by **removing** any rows that are in common between the two datasets.

# Look at the stop words
This dataset is available to you as soon as you load **tidytext**. 

There are three lexicons - I usually use all three.


``` r
stop_words 
```

```
## # A tibble: 1,149 × 2
##    word        lexicon
##    &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;  
##  1 a           SMART  
##  2 a's         SMART  
##  3 able        SMART  
##  4 about       SMART  
##  5 above       SMART  
##  6 according   SMART  
##  7 accordingly SMART  
##  8 across      SMART  
##  9 actually    SMART  
## 10 after       SMART  
## # ℹ 1,139 more rows
```

# Count
Let's try counting again without the stop words included.

.pull-left[


``` r
eugene_tidy_words %&gt;%

  count(word, sort = TRUE)

class: inverse-orange middle
# Working with data

---
# Getting started
* To make it as easy as possible, Daniel Anderson wrote package to make accessing a set of EDFacts data easier. Let's play with that one if time permits

* Install with 


``` r
#detach("package:edld652", unload = TRUE)
remotes::install_github("datalorax/edld652", force = TRUE)
#set_key("maithgopalan_testkey")
```
---
# Setting your key
* When you first load the package, you will see a message asking you to set a key.

* There is a document on canvas showing you how to do this. We'll go through it together now.

* You only need to do this once, then you can forget about it.

* Please do not share this key with others outside of this class - don't commit it to any repo.

* After you've set your key, go to **Session** on your menu and select **Restart R**.

---
# Check to see if all is working
After you've done everything on the prior slide, run the following to make sure it's working


``` r
library(edld652)
# list_datasets()
```

---
# Accessing a dataset

* The `list_datasets()` function shows you a list of all available datasets

* You can import any of these into R with the `get_data()` function by passing the name of the dataset as a string.

For example: Average cohort graduate rates for local education agency data, 2011 to 2019


``` r
acgd &lt;- get_data("EDFacts_acgr_lea_2011_2019")
```

# Accessing documentation

* The names of the datasets themselves can sometimes be a bit cryptic

* The variable names are often not interpretable at all (particularly the financial data)

* You can access the documentation for any dataset with the `get_documentation()` function, again passing the name of the dataset

* This function operates slightly differently on Mac/Windows

---
* Mac
  + Creates a folder in your current working directory called `data-documentation`
  + Downloads the documentation and places it in that folder
  + Opens the documentation
  + If the same documentation is requested again, skip the download and just open
* Windows
  + Prints a link to your console where documentation can be downloaded

# Data demo

For the next 30 minutes or so we will: 

* Walk through the [overview of the course data](../2021-12-10-accessing-the-data/) together, and then 

* Work in small groups to continue to explore the data and come up with new visualizations on your own.
