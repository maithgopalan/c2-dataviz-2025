## Overview
You will work on reviewing your peer's final project!

## Lab Tasks
You will be assigned to one other person/group's project to review their code as part of an in-class lab session on Week 9. The purpose of this exercise is to learn from each other. Programming is an immensely open-ended enterprise and there are lots of winding paths that all ultimately end up at the same destination. In terms of visualization, there is certainly plenty of room for artistic license, but certain design decisions (as we will learn) can lead to more interpretable and better data communication. Peer review is a chance to learn from your peers both by reviewing their work and by having your work reviewed. Fork and then clone your peer's github repo and then review their work-in-progress. 

During your peer review, you must (at minimum) note the following:

1. At least three areas of strength
2. At least one thing you learned from reviewing their script
3. At least one and no more than three areas for improvement for each visualization.
4. Comments on both the code leading up to (and including) the visualization, and the visualization itself (aesthetics, best practices, etc.).

Making your code publicly available can feel daunting. The purpose of this portion of the final project is to help us all learn from each other, not to denigrate. Under no circumstances will overly harsh/negative comments be tolerated. Any comments that could be perceived as overly critical and/or outside the scope of the code, will result in an immediate score of zero.

Be constructive in your feedback. Be kind. We are all learning.

## Finishing up
When you have finished the above, just share your peer review on Canvas
