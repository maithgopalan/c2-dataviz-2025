## Lab Tasks
Any task that you think is appropriate to get you started on your final projects

- clean data 
- plan format for web-deployment
- publish one visualization 

Submit a bulleted list of what you have accomplished as part of your final projects

## Finishing up
When you have finished the above, just share the progress report on Canvas. Note that by the beginning of next week's class, you will need to share your work-in-progress github repo with a colleague for peer review
