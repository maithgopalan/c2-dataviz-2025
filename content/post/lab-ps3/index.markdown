## Overview
This is the last lab problem set you will work on so that you have enough time to work on your final projects!
The purpose of this lab is to showcase your understanding of complex plots. You also don't have to create any new plots! But learn to save/pull older plots you created in prior lab sessions to create complex plots here.  

## Data
You can work with any dataset we have used in the prior labs (e.g., gapminder.csv, honeyproduction.csv, etc.)

## Lab Tasks 

1. Create two plots from the same data. Choose wisely - so that they are two different types of plots (also note: plots with `facet_wrap` doesn't count here!)
  
2. Now combine those plots side-by-side using `library(patchwork)` we learned in week 5

3. Now combine those plots by stacking them vertically (also using `library(patchwork)` we learned in week 5

4. Which one do you prefer when comparing #1 vs. #2 vs. #3? Reflect briefly.

# Finishing up
As always, when you have finished the above, upload your rendered (knit) pdf file to canvas.
