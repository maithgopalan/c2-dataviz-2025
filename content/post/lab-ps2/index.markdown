## Overview

The purpose of this lab is to get you more familiar with scale_*() options for visualizing the data and learn to explore what seems to work better. Specifically, you will work with changing colors, shapes, and sizes.

## Data 

You will use the same `gapminder.csv` dataset we used in Lab 3. 

## Tasks

# You got to work primarily just with color in lab 3. But scale functions also work for other aesthetics like shape or size. To see that, create a scatter plot with just one year 

## x mapped to gdpPercap
## y mapped to lifeExp 
## color and shape mapped to continent and
## size mapped to pop
## Show x-axis scale to be shown in log-scale (Hint: use scale_x_log10) 

# Change colors and shapes of the point 

Hint 1: Use `scale_color_*()` and with `scale_shape_*()`
Hint 2: If you run `?pch` in your console or search for `pch` in the help, you will see possible shapes

# Try changing the size next 

# Finally, If you load the {scales} library (which is installed as part of {tidyverse} but isnâ€™t automatically loaded), you can use some neat helper functions to reformat the text that shows up in plots. For instance, we can make it so population is formatted as a number with commas every 3 numbers, and the x-axis is formatted as dollars. Try that.
