## Overview
Because we will have a visitor today, this is a very short lab. The purpose of this lab is to help you implement some labels/annotations to reduce clutter and refine your plot

## Data
We'll be working with the same *gapminder.csv* file that you used for Lab PS2

## Lab Tasks
1. Recreate the final plot you generated in Lab PS-2 with just the countries in the American Continent

2. Now, can you add labels to the countries as there are fewer categories to compare? 

3. A bit cluttered, eh; So highlight (hint: use `gghighlight`) only those countries that have life expectancy greater than 75.

4. Maybe, try a marked up ellipse (hint: use `ggforce` library and `geom_mark_ellipse`) to highlight the two outliers on the SW grid of the plot instead of gghightlight

### Which one do you prefer between #3 and #4? Reflect briefly

## Finishing up
When you have finished the above, upload your rendered pdf file to canvas.
